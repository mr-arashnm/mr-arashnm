# 🌟 Hey, I’m **Arash NazariManesh**

### 🚀 *AI & Backend Developer* | 🐧 *Linux & Open-Source Enthusiast* | 🔍 *System Design Learner*

## 👋 Who Am I?

I’m Arash — a Computer Engineering student and a backend-focused developer who loves thinking in systems, debugging deep problems, designing clean APIs, and building projects that actually *scale*.

I spend most of my time designing backend architectures, reading specs instead of tutorials, experimenting with distributed systems concepts, and learning how to combine AI with robust backend infrastructure.

My development philosophy revolves around:

- **Writing maintainable, clean, production-ready code**
- **Thinking in terms of architecture, not just functions**
- **Using Linux as my natural habitat**
- **Never accepting “it just works” — I need to know *why***

If you're reading this, you probably care about code quality, architecture, or problem-solving — so you're in the right place.

# 🧠 Technical Skillset

*(Ordered by depth & real-world experience)*

### 🚀 Languages

<p>
  <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-ffd43b?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=blue"/>
  <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Java-b07219?style=for-the-badge&logo=openjdk&logoColor=white"/>
  <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/C++-00599C?style=for-the-badge&logo=cplusplus&logoColor=white"/>
</p>

**Python** is my primary tool for backend development and AI experiments.
**Java** is what I’m currently mastering for enterprise-grade backend architecture.
**C++** is where I learned how computers *really* work.

### 🏗 Backend Frameworks & Architectures

<p>
  <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Django-092E20?style=for-the-badge&logo=django&logoColor=white"/>
  <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/FastAPI-05998B?style=for-the-badge&logo=fastapi&logoColor=white"/>
  <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/SpringBoot-6DB33F?style=for-the-badge&logo=springboot&logoColor=white"/>
</p>

Where I shine:

- Designing RESTful APIs with clean structure
- Authentication & security patterns
- Async patterns in FastAPI
- Enterprise-grade patterns with Spring Boot
- Building modular, scalable, component-based backends
- Clean, layered architecture (DTO, services, repositories)

### 🗄 Databases & Storage

<p>
  <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/PostgreSQL-31648C?style=for-the-badge&logo=postgresql&logoColor=white"/>
  <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Redis-D92C21?style=for-the-badge&logo=redis&logoColor=white"/>
  <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/MongoDB-4EA94B?style=for-the-badge&logo=mongodb&logoColor=white"/>
</p>

- PostgreSQL for real relational modeling
- Redis for caching, rate limiting, message queues
- MongoDB for flexible unstructured data

I enjoy designing schemas, indexing strategies, and understanding the trade-offs between consistency and performance.

### 🐧 Linux & DevOps Mindset

<p>
  <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Linux-FCC624?style=for-the-badge&logo=linux&logoColor=black"/>
  <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Debian-A81D33?style=for-the-badge&logo=debian&logoColor=white"/>
</p>

Debian is my main environment.
I use Linux not just as an OS, but as a *development philosophy*.
Understanding processes, sockets, permissions, logs, and networking makes backend engineering 10× easier — and more enjoyable.

# 🔥 What I’m Building & Learning

### 📘 Currently Learning

- **Spring Boot & Java ecosystem** — dependency injection, JPA, MVC patterns, layered architecture
- **Enterprise design patterns** — Observer, Adapter, Facade, Builder
- **Scaling strategies** — load balancing, caching layers, microservices basics

### 🧪 Current Project

### **Unitall**

A personal software platform I’m actively building — combining backend design, distributed patterns, and clean architecture.
I'm treating it like a real-world product: structured docs, modular code, testing, and scalability in mind.

### 🔍 Research Interest

Working through IDS concepts (Intrusion Detection Systems) with the goal of eventually building a functional, efficient, and intelligently tuned IDS.

# 🎯 Long-Term Vision

I’m pushing my career towards:

### 🚀 1. **Becoming a Full-Stack / Backend engineer with strong security foundations**

(Not just writing code — understanding systems end-to-end)

### 🚀 2. **Building a startup**

I enjoy solving real problems with software that feels *intentional* and *well-engineered*.

### 🚀 3. **Publishing a proper research paper**

Preferably in:

- systems security
- distributed architectures
- or practical applications of AI in backend systems

### 🚀 4. **Migration and joining a strong engineering team**

Somewhere I can learn from engineers smarter than me — and contribute meaningfully.
